moodle-local_loginas
====================

Initially forked from [moodle-local_loginas](https://github.com/itamart/moodle-local_loginas),
this version allows you to login as any user in a course, without having to rely on a pre-defined list.
It adds the list of users to the bottom of the "Settings" block and only shows up if you are a site admin.
